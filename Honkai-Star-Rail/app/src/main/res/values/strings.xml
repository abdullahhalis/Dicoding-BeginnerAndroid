        <item>A swordsman who abandoned his body to become a blade. Birth name unknown. He pledges loyalty to \"Destiny\'s Slave,\" and possesses a terrifying self-healing ability. Blade wields an ancient sword riddled with cracks, just like his body and his mind.</item>
        <item>A spirited and quirky young girl who is into all the things girls her age are interested in, such as taking photos.

        <item>Herta space station\'s true master. As the human with the highest IQ on the Blue, she only does what she\'s interested in, dropping projects the moment she loses interest — the best example being the space station. She typically appears in the form of a remote-controlled puppet. \"It\'s about seventy percent similar to how I looked as a child.\" — Herta</item>
        <item>A young girl raised by a robot. Her perceptiveness and tenacity are far beyond her years. For Clara, Svarog\'s logical calculations are the laws of the world and are infallible.

        <item>A vivacious young lady of the Vidyadhara race, she is known as the \"Healer Lady\" due to her expertise with medicine. She often dishes out unorthodox prescriptions such as \"Stay well hydrated\" and \"Get a good night\'s rest.\" Bailu cannot bear to see people suffer, and that\'s why you\'ll see her with her eyes shut tightly as she cures ailments. \"As long as they\'re cured, that\'s all that matters, right?\"</item>
        <item>The spirited lieutenant of the Xianzhou Luofu, and also its most proficient swordsman. He was born for the sword and is obsessed with it.
